<p>InSpec is one of the tools of the Security Automation workflow and operates easily with orchestration and configuration management tools found in the DevOps world.</p>
<p>As you can see from the picture below, the process from Requirement Documents - like SRGs, STIGs and CIS Benchmarks - to visualized test results is a bit of a journey.</p>
<p>This challenge is what the <a href="https://saf.mitre.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITRE Security Automation Framework<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> or MITRE SAF was developed to simplify.</p>
<p>To make the journey from Requirement Document to automated tests and back again a little easier to navigate.</p>

<p>We hope that durning the course of this class you will start to become familiar and comfortable with a few - if not all - of the tools, parts and processes involved in the end-to-end process and have the confidence to start automating your compliance journey with us.</p>
<p>Let's get started ...</p>
