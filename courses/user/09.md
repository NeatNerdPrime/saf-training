## 9. Using an --input-file to tailor specifics

The following inputs may be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/).

In the below example we are using the inputs for the [Redhat 8 Github profile](https://github.com/CMSgov/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline).  We can tailor the following inputs in a new file called `inputs.yml` and pass that into our execution script.

```yml
# Used by InSpec checks 
# InSpec Tests that are known to consistently have long run times can be disabled with this attribute
# Acceptable values: false, true
# (default: false)
disable_slow_controls: 

# Used by InSpec check 
# list of system files that should be allowed to change from an rpm verify point of view
rpm_verify_perms_except: []

# Used by InSpec check 
# list of system files that should be allowed to change from an rpm verify point of view
rpm_verify_integrity_except: []

# Used by InSpec check (default: false)
# Do NOT set to 'true' UNLESS the server is documented as being used as a log aggregation server. 
log_aggregation_server: false

# Used by InSpec check  (default: [])
# Known application groups that are allowed to have world-writeable files or directories
application_groups: []

# Used by InSpec check (default: false)
# Do NOT set to 'true' UNLESS use of X Windows System is documented and approved. 
x11_enabled: false

# Accounts of known managed users (Array)
user_accounts: []

# System accounts that support approved system activities. (Array) (defaults shown below)
known_system_accounts:
  [
    "root",
    "bin",
    "daemon",
    "adm",
    "lp",
    "sync",
    "shutdown",
    "halt",
    "mail",
    "operator",
    "nobody",
    "systemd-bus-proxy",
  ]

# 
# (enabled or disabled)
smart_card_status: "enabled"

# 
# The path to the logging package
log_pkg_path: "/etc/rsyslog.conf"

# 
# 
# Users exempt from home directory-based controls in array
# format
exempt_home_users: []

# 
# main grub boot config file
grub_main_cfg: "/boot/grub2/grub.cfg"

# superusers for grub boot ( array )
grub_superusers: ["root"]

# grub boot config files
grub_user_boot_files: ["/boot/grub2/user.cfg"]

# 
# superusers for efi boot ( array )
efi_superusers: ["root"]

# efi boot config files
efi_user_boot_files: ["/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/user.cfg"]

# main efi boot config file
efi_main_cfg: "/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg"

# 
# system accounts that support approved system activities
admin_logins: []

# 
# should dconf have smart card authentication (e.g., true or false <- no quotes!)
multifactor_enabled: true

# 
# approved configured tunnels prepended with word 'conn'
# Example: ['conn myTunnel']
approved_tunnels: []

# 
# Is the target expected to be a virtual machine
virtual_machine: false
```

For this example we have 3 controls that run very long depending on the file system that is being queried. Our `inputs.yml` file could look like this:

```yaml
# Used by InSpec checks V-71849, V-71855, V-72037
# InSpec Tests that are known to consistently have long run times (V-71849, V-71855, V-72037) can be disabled with this attribute
# Acceptable values: false, true
# (default: false)
disable_slow_controls: true
```
