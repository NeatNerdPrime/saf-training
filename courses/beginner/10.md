## Profile Inheritance and Overlays

In addition to its own controls, an InSpec profile can bring in the controls from another InSpec profile. Additionally, when inheriting the controls from another profile, a profile can skip or even modify those included controls.

When a profile includes controls from another profile, it is usually referred to as a “meta profile” or a “profile overlay.” Those of us with Chef background sometimes call it a “wrapper profile”.

As a reminder, here are the controls that are in the `my_nginx` profile:

```ruby
# my_nginx
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-conf-file' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration file'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should exist.'
end

control 'nginx-conf-perms' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration permissions'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
end

control 'nginx-shell-access' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX shell access'
  desc 'The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.'
```

### Defining the Profile Dependency  

For a profile to use controls from another profile, the dependency needs to be included in the `depends` section of the `inspec.yml` file. For example, you can develop my_nginx_overlay that uses controls from my_nginx profile. In that case, the `depends` section of `inspec.yml` of my_nginx_overlay should list the name and location of my_nginx. One way of declaring the dependency is:

```yaml
name: my_nginx_overlay
# Metadata

depends:
  - name: my_nginx
    path: ../my_nginx
    # {path relative to the overlay}
```

Once defined in the `inspec.yml` file, controls from the included profiles can be used!

### Including All Controls

With the `include_controls` in a profile, all controls from the named profile will be executed every time the including profile is executed. Below you can see an example of a profile and overlay.

```ruby
# my_nginx_overlay
include_controls 'my_nginx'
```

In the example above, every time `my_nginx_overlay` profile is executed, all the controls from `my_nginx` profile are also executed. Therefore, the following controls would be executed for `my_nginx_overlay`:

 - nginx-version
 - nginx-modules
 - nginx-conf-file
 - nginx-conf-perms
 - nginx-shell-access

### Skipping a Control

What if one of the controls from the included profile does not apply to your environment? Luckily, it is not necessary to maintain a slightly-modified copy of the included profile just to delete a control. The skip_control command tells InSpec to not run a particular control.

```ruby
# my_nginx_overlay

include_controls 'my_nginx' do
  skip_control 'nginx-conf-perms'
end
```

```ruby
# my_nginx

control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-conf-file' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration file'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should exist.'
end

control 'nginx-conf-perms' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration permissions'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
end

control 'nginx-shell-access' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX shell access'
  desc 'The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.'
```
In the above example, all controls from `my_nginx` profile and `my_nginx_overlay` profile will be executed every time my-app-profile is executed **except** for control `second-overlay-control` from the `my_nginx_overlay` profile.

### Modifying a Control  

Let’s say a particular control from an included profile should still run, but the impact isn’t appropriate? Perhaps the test should still run, but if it fails it should be treated as low severity instead of high severity?

When a control is included, it can also be modified!

```ruby
# my_nginx profile
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-conf' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
end

include_controls 'my_nginx_overlay' do
  control 'second-overlay-control' do
    impact 0.5
  end
end
```

```ruby
# my_nginx_overlay
control 'first-overlay-control' do
  impact 1.0
end
control 'second-overlay-control' do
  impact 1.0
end
```
In the above example, all controls from `my_nginx` profile are executed along with all the controls from the including profile, `my_nginx_overlay`. However, should control `second-overlay-control` fail, it will be raised with an impact of `0.5` instead of the originally-intended impact of `1.0`.

### Selectively Including Controls

If there are only a handful of controls that should be executed from an included profile, it’s not necessary to skip all the unneeded controls, or worse, copy/paste those controls bit-for-bit into your profile. Instead, use the `require_controls` command.


```ruby
# my_nginx profile  
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-conf' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
end

require_controls 'my_nginx_overlay' do
  control 'first-overlay-control'
  control 'third-overlay-control'
end
```
 
 
```ruby
# my_nginx_overlay
control 'first-overlay-control'
control 'second-overlay-control'
control 'third-overlay-control'
control 'fourth-overlay-control'
control 'fifth-overlay-control'
```

Whenever `my_nginx` is executed, in addition to its own controls, it will run only the controls specified in the `require_controls` block. In the case, the following controls would be executed:

 - nginx-version
 - nginx-modules
 - nginx-conf
 - first-overlay-control
 - third-overlay-control

Controls `second-overlay-control`, `fourth-overlay-control`, and `fifth-overlay-control` would not be run, just as if they were manually skipped. This method of including specific controls ensures only the controls specified are executed; if new controls are added to a later version of `my_nginx_overlay`, they would not be run.

And, just the way its possible to modify controls when using `include_controls`, controls can be modified as well.


```ruby
# my_nginx profile  
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
end

control 'nginx-conf' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
end

require_controls 'my_nginx_overlay' do
  control 'first-overlay-control' do
    impact 0.5
  end
  control 'third-overlay-control'
end
```

```ruby
# my_nginx_overlay
control 'first-overlay-control' do
  impact 1.0
end

control 'second-overlay-control'
control 'third-overlay-control'
control 'fourth-overlay-control'
control 'fifth-overlay-control'
```

As with the prior example, only `first-overlay-control` and `third-overlay-control` are executed, but if `first-overlay-control` fails, it will report with an impact of `0.5` instead of the originally-intended `1.0` impact.
