## GitHub Actions

Our profile utilizes GitHub Actions as its primary CI/CD process. The Actions are separated by general business or process functions, allowing for a clear distinction between the workflow stages that we are testing.

### [`lint-profile.yml`](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint-profile.yml)

This action checks out the repository, installs Ruby and InSpec, then runs `bundle exec inspec check .` to validate the structure and syntax of the InSpec profile and its Ruby code.

### [`verify-ec2.yml`](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/blob/main/.github/workflows/verify-ec2.yml)

This action performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs Ruby, InSpec, AWS CLI, and Test Kitchen along with its drivers.
3. Sets up the 'runner'.
4. Configures access to the AWS VPC environment.
5. Runs the `vanilla` and `hardened` test suites.
6. Displays a summary of the test suite results.
7. Saves the test suite results.
8. Uploads the results to our Heimdall Demo server.
9. Determines the success or failure of the test run based on the validation of the test suite results against the `threshold.yml` files for each test suite (`hardened` and `vanilla`).

### [`verify-container.yml`](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/blob/main/.github/workflows/verify-container.yml)

This action performs similar steps to `verify-ec2.yml`, with a key additional step of configuring access to the required container registries - Platform One and Red Hat.
