## Understanding Security Benchmarks

## Key Differences from Traditional Software

Security benchmarks differ from traditional software development in several critical ways:

1. **Completeness Requirement**
   - Traditional Software: Can be released with partial features
   - Security Benchmarks: Must meet ALL requirements for a specific version

2. **Version Specificity**
   - Each benchmark version is a complete, standalone entity
   - InSpec profiles must match their corresponding benchmark version exactly

## Development Approaches

Two common approaches to benchmark development:

- **Micro Approach**: Gradual, incremental development
- **Massive Approach**: Complete implementation in larger chunks

> üí° **Key Point**: Both approaches are valid - choose based on your team's workflow preferences.

## Version Control Best Practices

### Working with Branches

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never work directly on 'main'
- Always fork from the latest release
- Consider 'main' or 'development' branches as pre-release candidates

## Practical Exercise

Try answering these questions:

1. Why can't security benchmarks be released incrementally?
2. How should you handle new requirements that arise between releases?
3. What branch strategy would you use for a new benchmark version?

**Remember**: Security benchmark validation is binary - it either meets all requirements or it doesn't.
