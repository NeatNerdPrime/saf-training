## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Identify the three types of profile updates
- Understand the scope of STIG and CIS Benchmark updates
- Recognize the forward-only nature of security benchmark updates

## Types of Profile Updates

Security benchmark profiles require regular updates to maintain their effectiveness. Let's explore the three main types of updates:

### 1. Patch Updates (Minor Changes)

- Frequency: Weekly to monthly
- Purpose: Address corner cases and improve testing code
- Version Change Example: v1.12.4 → v1.12.5
- Typical Changes: Bug fixes, code improvements, test coverage expansion

### 2. Release Updates (Intermediate Changes)

- Triggered by: STIG Benchmark owner releases
- Example: RHEL STIG V1R12 → V1R13
- Includes: New security requirements, updated controls

### 3. Major Version Updates

- Triggered by: New product versions
- Examples:
  - RHEL 8 → RHEL 9
  - Windows Server 2019 → Windows Server 2022

## Understanding Update Scope

Important concepts to remember:

- Updates are version-specific
- Changes only move forward ("forward-only" process)
- No "back-patching" to older versions
- Each requirement maps to:
  - Source SRG document
  - Control Correlation Identifier (CCI)
  - Unique Rule and STIG IDs

Example requirement identifiers:

```ruby
tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227'
tag gid: 'V-230221'
tag rid: 'SV-230221r858734_rule'
tag stig_id: 'RHEL-08-010000'
tag fix_id: 'F-32865r567410_fix'
tag cci: ['CCI-000366']
```
