## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a Release Update is and when it's needed
- Learn the step-by-step process of creating a Release Update
- Master the key components of Release Update management

## What is a Release Update?

A Release Update is a structured process for updating Security Automation Framework (SAF) profiles to accommodate new benchmark versions. This process ensures consistent quality and maintains traceability of changes.

## Release Update Workflow

### Step 1: Branch Creation

Create a new branch named `v#{x}R#{x+1}` from either:

- The main branch
- Latest patch release branch

### Step 2: Generate Delta

Run the `saf generate delta` workflow to update:

- Control metadata
- inspec.yml configuration
- README.md documentation
- Other profile elements

> Note: This process preserves existing `describe` blocks and Ruby code logic

### Step 3: Change Management

Follow these best practices to organize your work:

#### 3.1 Control Tracking

- Create a tracking table (CSV or Markdown) containing:
  - New control IDs
  - Status (completed/pending)
  - Associated PR links
  - Validation checkboxes

#### 3.2 Quality Assurance Steps

1. **Validation Checklist**
   - [ ] Control requirements reviewed
   - [ ] Code changes verified
   - [ ] Tests updated
   - [ ] Documentation current

2. **Infrastructure Updates**
   - Update hardening content:
     - Ansible playbooks
     - Puppet modules
     - Chef cookbooks
     - Docker images
     - Vagrant boxes

3. **Metadata Management**
   - Update all version references
   - Verify control titles
   - Check benchmark labels

## Tips for Success

- Focus on controls with modified `check text` or `fix text`
- Unchanged control text typically means no code changes needed
- Use PR links to track changes in your tracking table
- Maintain CI/CD pipeline health throughout updates

## Next Steps

After completing these steps, proceed with the Patch Update workflow, keeping in mind that Release Updates typically involve more extensive validation.
