## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will understand:

- The purpose and function of Test Kitchen's converge stage
- How to use different infrastructure configurations
- The differences between vanilla and hardened environments

## Test Kitchen Converge Stage

The `converge` stage applies system configurations using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools. This crucial stage transforms your environment from a base state to your desired configuration.

::: info Let 'em cook
Think of the converge stage as "applying your recipe" - it takes your raw ingredients (base system) and follows your instructions to create the final dish (configured system).
:::

Supported configuration tools include:

- Ansible Playbooks (used in this course)
- Puppet
- Chef
- Terraform
- Shell scripts

## EC2 and Vagrant Converge

We implement two distinct configurations using 'wrapper playbooks':

1. **Vanilla Environment**
   - Purpose: Establishes baseline test environment
   - Implementation: Basic configuration playbook

2. **Hardened Environment**
   - Purpose: Creates security-enhanced environment
   - Components:
     - Base vanilla configuration
     - RHEL8-STIG security controls
     - Ansible Galaxy dependencies
     - Custom roles and requirements

::: note While some hardening tasks are disabled for testing, this doesn't compromise our security validation goals.

## Hands-on Practice

### Container Converge

Our container strategy utilizes two Red Hat UBI9 (Universal Base Image) variants.  Take a look at the SAF's [RHEL9 InSpec profile](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/tree/main) which also includes our Test Kitchen and Ansible code that we use to test that our InSpec tests work properly.

1. **Vanilla Container**

This container uses the `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:9.3-1610` image from RedHat's community repositories.

It represents a standard, out-of-the-box configuration.
- Community maintained
- Standard configuration

2. **Hardened Container**

This container uses the `registry1.dso.mil/ironbank/redhat/ubi/ubi9` image from Red Hat's Platform One Iron Bank project.

It represents a security-enhanced configuration.
- STIG-compliant
- Regular security updates
- Platform One certified


Try these exercises:

1. Compare the contents of vanilla and hardened playbooks
2. Identify key security configurations in the RHEL9-STIG role
3. Examine the wrapper playbook structure in the spec/ directory

## Summary

- Converge stage implements your desired system configurations
- Multiple implementation tools available (Ansible, Puppet, Chef, etc.)
- Two primary configurations: vanilla (baseline) and hardened (security-enhanced)
- Container implementations use different images with different security postures

::: info Next Steps
Practice running the converge stage with both vanilla and hardened configurations to understand the differences in outcomes.
