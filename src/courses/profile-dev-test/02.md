## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:

- Understand the branch strategy for STIG profiles
- Learn about semantic versioning in the context of STIG releases
- Know how to navigate tags and releases

## Repository Structure Overview

The repository uses a structured branching and tagging strategy to manage STIG profile versions and updates. This organization ensures reliable tracking of changes and stable releases for production use.

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branch

- Purpose: Active development and testing
- Contains: Latest code and patches
- Best for: Development and testing workflows
- Note: For production, use stable releases instead

### Version Branches (`v{x}r{xx}`)

- Purpose: Track major STIG benchmark releases
- Example: `v1r12` for Version 1, Release 12
- Aligns with: Official DISA STIG releases
- Reference: [DISA STIG Document Library](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/)

## Version Control Strategy

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Format: `MAJOR.RELEASE.PATCH`

- MAJOR: Matches STIG version
- RELEASE: Matches STIG release
- PATCH: Profile updates between STIG releases

Example timeline:

## Tags

### Current Tag

We don't use a specific `current` or `latest` tag. The `current`/`latest` tag for the profile and repository will always be the latest major tag of the benchmark. For example, if `v1.12.3` is the latest Benchmark release from the STIG author, then the tag `v1.12` will point to the `v1.12.3` release of the code.

To use the current `main`, point directly to the GitHub repo.

### Major Tags

Major tags point to the latest patch release of the benchmark. For example, `v1.3` and `v1.3.0` represent the first release of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG V1R3 Benchmark. The `v1.12.xx` tag(s) would represent the V1R12 Benchmark releases as we find bugs, fixes, or general improvements to the testing profile. This tag will point to its `v{x}r{xx}` counterpart.

## Patch Releases

The latest patch release always points to the major release for the profile.

For example, after releasing `v1.12.0`, we will point `v1.12` to that patch release: `v1.12.0`. When an issue is found, we will fix, tag, and release `v1.12.1`. We will then 'move' the `v1.12` tag so that it points to tag `v1.12.1`. This way, your pipelines can choose if they want to pin on a specific release of the InSpec profile or always run 'current'.
