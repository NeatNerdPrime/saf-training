## Learning Objectives

- Understand what constitutes a Major Version Update and why they occur
- Master the requirement alignment process using multiple identification methods
- Learn to use available tools for version transition
- Develop strategies for efficient code migration
- Implement best practices for version control and testing

## What is a Major Version Update?

A Major Version Update occurs when transitioning to a new STIG Benchmark version that introduces a completely new Rule ID index. Unlike minor Release Updates, this process requires careful mapping between old and new requirements.

## Key Concepts

### Requirement Alignment

:::tip ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Create a spreadsheet to track your requirement mappings during the alignment process.
:::

When moving between major versions (e.g., RHEL 8 v1R12 to RHEL 9 V1R1), we need to align existing tests with new requirements using:

- SRG IDs (Security Requirements Guide IDs)
- CCIs (Control Correlation Identifiers)
- Titles and descriptions when necessary

### The Alignment Process

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Compare old and new benchmark requirements
   - Identify matching controls using common identifiers
   - Note any split or merged requirements

2. **Using Available Tools**
   - MITRE Vulcan assists in alignment process
   - Current Delta tool requires manual verification
   - Future automation improvements are in development

3. **Code Migration**
   - Transfer InSpec/Ruby code to new requirement locations
   - Verify control mappings
   - Update test code as needed

### Practical Example

Consider this simplified alignment scenario:

## Best Practices

- Document all requirement mappings
- Verify control alignments thoroughly
- Test extensively after migration

## What's Next

After alignment is complete, follow the standard Release Update process for:

- Setting up CI/CD
- Organizing controls
- Updating and testing requirements

## Summary

Major Version Updates require careful attention to requirement alignment and code migration. While tools like Vulcan help, some manual verification is still needed. Future improvements will streamline this process.
