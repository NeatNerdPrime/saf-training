## Prerequisites Knowledge

- Basic command line experience
- Familiarity with package managers
- Understanding of environment variables
- Basic Docker concepts

## Required Software Overview

Each tool listed below is essential for the course. We'll explain why you need each one:

- **RVM (Ruby Version Manager)** - Manages Ruby installations
- **Ruby v3+** - Core programming language for our testing framework
- **Git** - Version control for managing code
- **VS Code/IDE** - For writing and editing code
- **Docker** - For container-based testing
- **AWS CLI** - For interacting with AWS services

## Required Accounts Setup

Create accounts with these services before proceeding:

1. **AWS Console Account**
   - Purpose: Cloud infrastructure testing
   - Sign up: [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

2. **Platform One (P1) Account**
   - Purpose: Access to hardened containers
   - Register: [Platform One Registration](https://login.dso.mil/register)

3. **P1 Harbor Access**
   - Purpose: Container registry access
   - Get token: [Harbor Login](https://login.dso.mil/auth/realms/baby-yoda/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=harbor)

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Test Kitchen Variables

Important variables that control testing behavior:

- `INSPEC_CONTROL`: Specifies which single control to run in the `bundle exec kitchen verify` phase, useful for testing and debugging a single requirement.
  - default: `none`
- `KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML`: Specifies the target testing environment you want to use to run and validate the profile.
  - default: `none`
- `VANILLA_CONTAINER_IMAGE`: Specifies the Docker container image you consider 'not hardened' (used by `kitchen.container.yml`).
  - default: `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.9-1028`
- `HARDENED_CONTAINER_IMAGE`: Specifies the Docker container image you consider 'hardened' (used by `kitchen.container.yml`).
  - default: `registry1.dso.mil/ironbank/redhat/ubi/ubi8`

### 2. AWS Environment Setup

**Option 1: AWS Profiles (Recommended)**

- Easier management of multiple environments
- More secure than environment variables
- Setup guide: [AWS CLI Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

**Option 2: Environment Variables**

- Traditional AWS environment variables
- Documentation: [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Ruby Setup**
   - Install RVM or alternative Ruby manager
   - Install Ruby 3.1+
   - Configure OpenSSL and certificates

2. **AWS Configuration**
   - Install AWS CLI
   - Configure credentials
   - Test connection

3. **Project Setup**
   - Clone repository
   - Configure Harbor CLI access
   - Set up Docker registry access
   - Install dependencies

## Verification Steps

Run these commands to verify your setup:

- Verify your newly installed Ruby environment by running `ruby --version`.
- Confirm that InSpec was installed by running `bundle exec inspec --version`.
- Check that Test Kitchen was installed by running `bundle exec kitchen version`.
- Verify that your `aws-cli` is correctly configured by running `aws s3 ls` (or your preferred test command for AWS CLI).
- Confirm your bundle installation by running `bundle exec inspec --version`.
- Verify you can pull from RepoOne by running `docker pull https://repo1.dso.mil/dsop/redhat/ubi/ubi8`.
- Celebrate üéâÔ∏è if everything went well.
