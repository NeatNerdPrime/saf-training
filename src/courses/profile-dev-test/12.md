## Learning Objectives

- Understand what constitutes a patch update
- Learn the complete patch update workflow
- Master the testing and validation process

## What is a Patch Update?

A patch update is a minor modification to an InSpec profile that addresses specific issues, bugs, or improvements without changing core functionality. Common examples include:

- Fixing control logic errors
- Updating threshold values
- Improving error handling
- Adding missing test cases

## Step-by-Step Patch Update Process

### 1. Issue Documentation

- Create a detailed issue in the project repository
- Include specific examples of the problem
- Reference any related documentation
- Link: [Project Issues Page](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline/issues)

### 2. Environment Setup

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch from the target patch release tag
- Configure test environments:
  - AWS testing suite
  - Docker testing suite

### 3. Implementation

- Make necessary updates to:
  - Control logic
  - `inspec.yml` inputs
  - Threshold values
- Note: The InSpec version in `inspec.yml` is managed during release

### 4. Testing Protocol

Verify your changes across multiple environments:

- Vanilla systems
- Hardened systems
- Known bad states
- Known good states
- Edge cases and error conditions

Test contexts to cover:

- Container environments
- Virtual machines
- Physical hardware (1U machines)

### 5. Quality Assurance

Run the provided linting tools:

- `bundle exec rake lint`
- `bundle exec rake lint:autocorrect`

### 6. Commit and PR

- Commit your updates with a message including `Fixes #ISSUE`
- Open a PR from your fork to the project repository

### 7. Test Suite Verification

- Ensure the GitHub Action test suite passes
