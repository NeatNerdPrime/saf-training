## Background and Definitions

### Background

#### Evolution of STIGs and Security Benchmarks

The Department of Defense (DoD) has continually updated its databases that track rules and the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), which define those rules.

Initially, the system was known as the Vulnerability Management System (VMS).

In the STIGs, you might come across data elements that are remnants from previous systems. These include `Group Title` (`gid` or `gtitle`), `Vulnerability ID` (`VulnID`), `Rule ID` (`rule_id`), `STIG ID` (`stig_id`), and others.

A significant change was the shift from using `STIG ID` to `Rule ID` in many security scanning tools. This change occurred because the VMS used the `STIG_ID` as the primary index for the requirements in each benchmark.

However, when DISA updated the vendor STIG processes and replaced the VMS, they decided to migrate the primary ID from the `STIG ID` to the `Rule ID`, tracking changes in the rules.

Examples of tools that still use the `STIG ID`, either fully or partially, as a primary index include the DISA STIG Viewer, Nessus Audit Scans, and OpenSCAP client.

Understanding the historical context of these elements is essential, even if they might seem confusing.

Although some data from the XCCDF benchmarks still exist in our modern profiles, they are not used or rendered in modern InSpec profiles. The intention was to ensure easy and lossless conversion between XCCDF benchmarks and HDF profiles.

It was later realized that since the structure of these data elements was static, they could be easily reintroduced when converting back to an XCCDF benchmark. Therefore, including them in the profile was deemed unnecessary.
