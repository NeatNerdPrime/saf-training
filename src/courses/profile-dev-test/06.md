## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to set up a Docker testing environment
- Learn to use Test Kitchen with Docker containers
- Execute and interpret InSpec tests in containers
- Analyze test results using Heimdall Lite

## Prerequisites

- Docker or Podman installed and running
- Access to required container registries
- Basic understanding of command line operations

## Environment Setup

Before running tests, configure your environment:

1. Ensure Docker/Podman is running
2. Authenticate with your container registry
3. Clone the test profile repository
4. Navigate to the profile's root directory
5. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies

## Configure Test Kitchen

Set these environment variables:

```shell
> export KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.container.yml
> export VANILLA_CONTAINER_IMAGE=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.9-1028
> export HARDENED_CONTAINER_IMAGE=registry1.dso.mil/ironbank/redhat/ubi/ubi8
> (optional) export INSPEC_CONTROL='SV-230222'
```

## Running Through the Docker Test Suite

1. List the kitchen instances with: `bundle exec kitchen list`

```shell
➜  redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline git:(main*)bundle exec kitchen list
Instance       Driver  Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action    Last Error
vanilla-ubi8   Dokken  Dummy        Inspec    Dokken     <Not Created>  <None>
hardened-ubi8  Dokken  Dummy        Inspec    Dokken     <Not Created>  <None>
```

2. Create the kitchen instance: `bundle exec kitchen create vanilla`

```shell
-----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.5.1)
-----> Creating <vanilla-ubi8>...
      Creating kitchen sandbox at /Users/alippold/.dokken/kitchen_sandbox/de2da32d73-vanilla-ubi8
      Creating verifier sandbox at /Users/alippold/.dokken/verifier_sandbox/de2da32d73-vanilla-ubi8
      Building work image..
      Creating container de2da32d73-vanilla-ubi8
      Finished creating <vanilla-ubi8> (0m0.88s).
-----> Test Kitchen is finished. (0m1.77s)
```

3. Converge the kitchen instance: `bundle exec kitchen converge  vanilla`

```shell
➜  redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline git:(main*)bundle exec kitchen converge vanilla
-----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.5.1)
-----> Converging <vanilla-ubi8>...
      ...
      Finished converging <vanilla-ubi8> (0m0.00s).
-----> Test Kitchen is finished. (0m0.88s)
```

4. Run InSpec on the kitchen instance: `bundle exec kitchen verify vanilla`

```shell
-----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.5.1)
-----> Verifying <vanilla-ubi8>...
      Loaded redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline

Profile:   redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline (redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline)
Version:   1.12.0
Target:    docker://c4e89b7406dc0ebf8658fe90d6384d69885a7f07ab9bfbc91c85c64483868c44

...

Profile Summary: 0 successful controls, 1 control failure, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 0 successful, 4 failures, 0 skipped
```

## This is not the **Error** Your Looking For, move along

The error below is just Test Kitchen telling you that not all of the `controls` of the profile passed.

```shell
>>>>>> ------Exception-------
>>>>>> Class: Kitchen::ActionFailed
>>>>>> Message: 1 actions failed.
>>>>>>     Verify failed on instance <vanilla-ubi8>.  Please see .kitchen/logs/vanilla-ubi8.log for more details
>>>>>> ----------------------
>>>>>> Please see .kitchen/logs/kitchen.log for more details
>>>>>> Also try running `kitchen diagnose --all` for configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. For steps that apply to making updates, patches, and updates to the profile, see the next section, [Updating the Profile](#updating-the-profile).
2. Your InSpec scan results are located in the `./spec/results/` directory, named `./spec/results/ubi-8_*.`
3. Use Heimdall Lite to load both the `hardened` and `vanilla` results to ensure your changes and updates, "failed as expected and passed as expected and covered your corner cases."
