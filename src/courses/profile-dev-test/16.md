## Test Kitchen Create Stage

### What is the Create Stage?

The `create` stage is a fundamental part of Test Kitchen that prepares your testing environments. Think of it as setting up your test laboratory where you'll run your security tests.

### How it Works

Test Kitchen handles environment creation by:

- Fetching pre-configured system images
- Setting up virtual machines or containers
- Preparing the environment for testing

### Supported Platforms

Test Kitchen works with various platforms:

- AWS EC2 instances (using AMIs)
- Docker containers
- Vagrant boxes
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems

### Image Sources

Test Kitchen automatically pulls from:

- Amazon Marketplace
- DockerHub
- Vagrant Cloud
- Bento Box Repository
- Custom repositories (e.g., Platform One's Iron Bank)
- Local image storage
