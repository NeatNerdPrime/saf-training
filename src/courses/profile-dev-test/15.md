## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and benefits of Test Kitchen
- Describe the Test Kitchen workflow
- Differentiate between vanilla and hardened configurations
- Execute basic Test Kitchen commands

## What is Test Kitchen?

Test Kitchen is a powerful testing framework that allows developers to test infrastructure code across different platforms and configurations. Think of it as a laboratory where you can safely experiment with different system configurations without affecting your production environment.

## Test Kitchen Workflow

The testing process follows four key stages:

1. **Create** üèóÔ∏è
   - Spins up a fresh instance of your target platform
   - Sets up the basic environment

2. **Converge** üîÑ
   - Applies your infrastructure code
   - Configures the instance according to your specifications

3. **Verify** ‚úÖ
   - Runs your tests against the instance
   - Checks if everything is configured correctly

4. **Destroy** üßπ
   - Cleans up the test environment
   - Removes the instance completely

## Testing Configurations

We use two main testing configurations:

### Vanilla Configuration

- Stock installation with default settings
- No customization or hardening
- Represents "out-of-the-box" state
- Used as a baseline for comparison

### Hardened Configuration

- Implements security best practices
- Follows benchmark recommendations (e.g., RHEL V1R12)
- Represents the target secure state
- Applied during the converge phase

## Behind the Scenes: System Access

To enable testing, Test Kitchen makes minimal system modifications:

- Adds SSH private key authentication
- Sets up appropriate access protocols:
  - SSH for Unix/Linux systems
  - WinRM for Windows systems
