## 2.1 Requirements:
To conduct the delta process, the following are needed:

1. An inspec profile
    a. Clone or download an existing profile from a repository source to your local environment.
2. A guidance file (XCCDF)
    a. Download either a DISA STIG or a CIS Benchmark from the appropriate site.

::: note Using Generated Profile Stubs
Although not a requirement, it is recommended to use a generated profile stub from the `saf generate inspec_profile` command to use as a skeleton profile based on the XCCDF benchmark guidance (STIG or CIS). This ensures consistency across profiles.
:::

The [Delta CLI Tools section](./03.md#31-cli-tools) covers specific requirements for both the `delta` and `update_controls4delta` commands.
