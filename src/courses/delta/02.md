## Use Cases for Running Delta

[Use Case 1](#use-case-1) - Check and update control IDs based on new guidance (run update controls)
[Use Case 2](#use-case-2) - Update control IDs and metadata (run update controls)
[Use Case 3](#use-case-3) - Update control IDs based on group ID (run update controls)
[Use Case 4](#use-case-4) - No mappings were found using update controls (run Delta with fuzzy matching)
[Use Case 5](#use-case-5) - Generate stubs for new controls found in XCCDF (run Delta w/o fuzzy matching)
[Use Case 6](#use-case-6) - Need detailed logging of process (run Delta w/o fuzzy matching)

### Use Case 1
Updated guidances sometimes modify the control identification (IDs) values of a given control.
To make these modification from baseline X to baseline Y the update controls process with the
provided XCCDF guidance. The process checks if the new guidance changes the control numbers
and updates them if necessary.

### Use Case 2
Like Use Case 1 where the IDs are changed, the new controls identified in baseline Y may have
changed the control metadata (impact value, descriptions, etc). Running the update controls makes
use of baseline Y metadata and updates the control with the describe block (code) from baseline X.

### Use Case 3
If there is'nt any mapping between baseline X and Y using the default rule identification (rule Id)
for the control, it may be necessary to index the controls based on controls group identifications
(group Id). Running the update controls with the group Id may be required to provide a
mapping from baseline X to Y.

### Use Case 4
Running update controls may result in no controls being updated / no mappings were found from
baseline X to baseline Y. This could be due to there being too many revisions / releases between
the two baselines creating no way to  map between them. In this case, we have no alternative
but to use Delta with fuzzy matching.

### Use Case 5
Most often the new guidances contain new controls that weren't previously defined, in this
case running the delta process generates the control stubs with all metadata, minus the
describe block (code) content.

### Use Case 6


distinctions: 
if baseline Y has new controls not present in baseline X (new / not found)
if baseline X has controls not present in baseline Y (skipped)

Given a STIG specification and an inspec profile Delta can:
1. Apply revisions for minor releases to a STIG guidance
  Generating new controls in a STIG guidance
2. Apply revisions and control renamings for major releases to a STIG guidance
3. Map equivalent controls between two different inspec profiles
