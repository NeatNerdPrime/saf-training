## Use Cases for Running Delta

Use Case 1 - Update to verify if control IDs were changed (run update controls)
Use Case 2 - Update control IDs and metadata (run update controls)
Use Case 3 - Update control IDs based on group ID (run update controls)
Use Case 4 - No mappings were found using update controls (run Delta with fuzzy matching)
Use Case 5 - Generate stubs for new controls found in XCCDF (run Delta w/o fuzzy matching)
Use Case 6 - Need detailed logging of process (run Delta w/o fuzzy matching)

### Use Case 1

### Use Case 2

### Use Case 3

### Use Case 4

Running update controls may result in no controls being updated / no mappings were found from baseline X to baseline Y. This could be due to there being too many revisions / releases between the two baselines creating no way to  map between them. In this case, we have no alternative but to use Delta with fuzzy matching.

### Use Case 5

### Use Case 6


distinctions: 
if baseline Y has new controls not present in baseline X (new / not found)
if baseline X has controls not present in baseline Y (skipped)

Given a STIG specification and an inspec profile Delta can:
1. Apply revisions for minor releases to a STIG guidance
  Generating new controls in a STIG guidance
2. Apply revisions and control renamings for major releases to a STIG guidance
3. Map equivalent controls between two different inspec profiles
