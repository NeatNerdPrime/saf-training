## 4.1 Use Cases for Running Delta

There are several situations that warrant the use of the delta process. These are broken down into the following use cases:

1. [Use Case 1](#411-use-case-1) - Check and update control IDs and metadata based on new guidance (run update controls)

2. [Use Case 2](#412-use-case-2) - Update control IDs based on group ID (run update controls)

3. [Use Case 3](#413-use-case-3) - Update controls but create a backup (run update controls)

4. [Use Case 4](#414-use-case-4) - No mappings were found using update controls (run Delta with fuzzy matching)

5. [Use Case 5](#415-use-case-5) - Generate stubs for new controls found in the XCCDF Benchmark file (run Delta without fuzzy matching)

### 4.1.1 Use Case 1

Updated guidance sometimes modifies the control identification (ID) values of a given control. To make these modifications from baseline X to baseline Y, use the update controls process with the provided XCCDF guidance. The process checks if the new guidance changes the control numbers and updates them if necessary.

**Process:** Run `update_controls4delta`

### 4.1.2 Use Case 2

If there isn't any mapping between baseline X and Y using the default rule identification (rule ID) for the control, it may be necessary to index the controls based on control group identifications (group ID). Running the update controls with the group ID may be required to provide a mapping from baseline X to Y.

**Process:** Run `update_controls4delta`

### 4.1.3 Use Case 3

Similar to Use Cases 1 and 2, this use case updates controls in baseline X with new controls identified in baseline Y based on selected indexed identification but also creates a backup of the modified controls.

**Process:** Run `update_controls4delta`

### 4.1.4 Use Case 4

Running update controls may result in no controls being updated or no mappings being found from baseline X to baseline Y. This could be due to there being too many revisions or releases between the two baselines, creating no way to map between them. In this case, use Delta with fuzzy matching.

**Process:** Run `delta`

[return to top](#41-use-cases-for-running-delta)

### 4.1.5 Use Case 5

New guidance often contains new controls that weren't previously defined. In this case, running the delta process generates the control stubs with all metadata, except for the describe block (code) content.

**Process:** Run `delta`

### Suggested Enhancements for Education and Training

1. **Examples and Scenarios:** Provide real-world examples and scenarios for each use case to help students understand the practical applications.
2. **Interactive Exercises:** Include interactive exercises where students can practice running the commands (`update_controls4delta` and `delta`) in a controlled environment.
3. **Visual Aids:** Use flowcharts or diagrams to visually represent the processes described in each use case.
4. **Quizzes:** Add quizzes at the end of each section to reinforce learning and ensure comprehension.
5. **Glossary:** Include a glossary of terms used in the document to help students familiarize themselves with the terminology.
6. **Step-by-Step Guides:** Provide detailed, step-by-step guides for running the commands, including screenshots or terminal outputs to illustrate the expected results.
7. **Discussion Questions:** Add discussion questions at the end of each section to encourage critical thinking and group discussions.
