## InSpec Delta

### Overview

Inspec Delta is a SAF CLI functionality that automates and facilitates the process of changing inspec profile baselines.

The SAF CLI Delta process can include two distinct processes:
1. Updates Controls for Delta (`update_controls4delta`)
2. Delta (`delta`)

::: note
When referring to inspec profiles, there are distinctions:
Inspec profile repository: contains the controls, code, etc.
Inspec profile file: JSON formatted file containing profile summary, used as input for these delta process.
:::

### Update Controls for Delta



### Delta

update_controls4delta --> major releases

This process is used to prepare profile controls from one SRG or STIG baseline to another. 

The controls are updated based on guidance based on guidance provided by the appropriate Extendible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF).

Given a STIG specification and an inspec profile Delta can:
1. Apply revisions for minor releases to a STIG guidance
  Generating new controls in a STIG guidance
2. Apply revisions and control renamings for major releases to a STIG guidance
3. Map equivalent controls between two different inspec profiles


### Preparing the Profile Before Running Delta

Before running Delta, it's beneficial to format the profile to match the format Delta will use. This minimizes changes to only those necessary based on the guidance update. Follow these steps:

1. **Run Cookstyle:** Install the Cookstyle gem and use it to lint the controls into Cookstyle format. Verify the gem installation with `gem list cookstyle`. Create a `.rubocop.yml` file with the provided example settings or modify these settings via the command line. Run `cookstyle -a ./controls` and any tests you have for your profile.

```shell
AllCops:
  Exclude:
    - "libraries/**/*"

Layout/LineLength:
  Max: 1000
  AllowURI: true
  IgnoreCopDirectives: true

Naming/FileName:
  Enabled: false

Metrics/BlockLength:
  Max: 400

Lint/ConstantDefinitionInBlock:
  Enabled: false

# Required for Profiles as it can introduce profile errors
Style/NumericPredicate:
  Enabled: false

Style/WordArray:
  Description: "Use %w or %W for an array of words. (https://rubystyle.guide#percent-w)"
  Enabled: false

Style/RedundantPercentQ:
  Enabled: true

Style/NestedParenthesizedCalls:
  Enabled: false

Style/TrailingCommaInHashLiteral:
  Description: "https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_style.html#styletrailingcommainhashliteral"
  Enabled: true
  EnforcedStyleForMultiline: no_comma

Style/TrailingCommaInArrayLiteral:
  Enabled: true
  EnforcedStyleForMultiline: no_comma

Style/BlockDelimiters:
  Enabled: false

Lint/AmbiguousBlockAssociation:
  Enabled: false
```

2. **Run the SAF CLI Command:** Use `saf generate update_controls4delta` to check and update the control IDs with the provided XCCDF guidance. This process checks if the new guidance changes the control numbers and updates them if necessary. This minimizes the Delta output content and improves the visualization of the modifications provided by the Delta process.
