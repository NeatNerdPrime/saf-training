## 1.1 Class Overview

The purpose of this class is to demonstrate how the MITRE SAF Delta tool can be used to update or generate InSpec profiles. This includes updating an InSpec profile from an old guidance document to a newer guidance document and creating a new baseline profile from older revisions of the same baseline.

### 1.2 Class Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Understand the requirements, purpose, and functionality of the SAF Delta process tools: `update_controls4delta` and `delta`
- Update existing InSpec profiles to newer guidance documentation using `update_controls4delta` and `delta`
- Determine how and where to apply these tools in various scenarios (Use Cases)
- Use the delta fuzzy matching system to map controls between two profiles
- Identify and review delta process history with generated logs and artifacts
- Format InSpec profile controls appropriately before and/or after executing delta commands
