### 1.1.1 Class Objectives:

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Know the requirements for conducting the delta process
- Understand the purpose of the SAF Delta process tools, `update_controls4delta` and `delta`
- Use these tools to update inspec profiles
- Understand how and where to apply these tools in different situations (Use Cases)
- Use the delta fuzzy matching system to map controls between two profiles
- Be familiar with the delta process logging capabilities and generated artifacts
- Know how to format Inspec profile controls before and/or after executing delta commands
