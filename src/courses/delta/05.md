## 5.1 Logging Capabilities of Delta


### 5.1.1 CLIProcessOutput.log

A detailed log of the output of the command execution with additional information and metadata. 

[Example Log File Output](../../assets/downloads/CliProcessOutput.log)

### 5.1.2 delta.json

Automatically generated and outputted to the same directory as the outputted profile controls, this JSON file summarizes the results of the delta process. 

Results are summarized at the top of the report according to the type of change:
1. addedControlIDs: A list of new controls added to the profile
2. removedControlIDs: A list of controls removed from the profile
3. renamedControlIDs: A list of controls that had their IDs change
4. changedControlIDs: A list of controls with changes to the metadata

Details of the changes are given afterwards as follows:

1. addedControls: The contents of each control that was added to the profile
2. changedControls: The parts of each control that were modified / replaced during the command execution

[Example delta.json file](../../assets/downloads/delta.json)

### 5.1.3 Report Markdown File (.md)

Specified by the report flag (`-r`), generates a markdown formatted report of the same information found in the delta.json file.
