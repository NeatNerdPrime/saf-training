## InSpec Delta

### Preparing the Profile Before Running Delta

Before running Delta, it's beneficial to format the profile to match the format Delta will use. This minimizes changes to only those necessary based on the guidance update. Follow these steps:

1. **Run Rubocop:** Install the Cookstyle gem and use it to lint the controls into Cookstyle format. Verify the gem installation with `gem list cookstyle`. Create a `.rubocop.yml` file with the provided example settings or modify these settings via the command line. Run `cookstyle -a ./controls` and any tests you have for your profile.

```shell

```
