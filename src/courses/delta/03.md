## 3.1 CLI Tools

The delta process consists of one or both of the following commands:

1. Update Controls for Delta (`update_controls4delta`)
2. Delta (`delta`)

::: note About InSpec Profiles
When referring to InSpec profiles, there are distinctions:

- InSpec profile repository: Contains the controls, code, etc.
- InSpec profile file: A JSON formatted file containing a profile summary, used as input for the delta process.
:::

### 3.2 Update Controls for Delta

The `update_controls4delta` process is used to prepare profile controls from one [SRG](./02.md#glossary-of-terms) or [STIG/CIS](./02.md#glossary-of-terms) benchmark baseline to another. The controls are updated based on guidance provided by the appropriate Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format ([XCCDF](./02.md#glossary-of-terms)).

The `update_controls4delta` process may be the only command needed as it specifically updates existing controls from one baseline to another. Refer to [use cases for running delta](./04.html#use-cases-for-running-delta).

The process of preparing controls from one baseline to another (baseline X to Y) consists of:

1. Providing the directory where baseline X controls are located.
2. Providing or generating an InSpec JSON formatted file containing all baseline X controls.
    - The JSON file is generated using the [InSpec or Cinc-Auditor] JSON CLI command.
3. Providing an XCCDF file containing the new baseline Y guidance. The file is obtained from the appropriate site.
    - The baseline Y XCCDF lists all controls appropriate for the provided baseline. It often includes a field (legacy) indicating the control's previous name(s). The process uses this field to map old control names to the new controls.
    - If no mapping is found, then the `delta` process must be invoked to convert the baselines ([see use cases](./04.html#use-cases-for-running-delta)).

You can invoke the command as follows:

```sh
saf generate update_controls4delta -X ./baseline_Y_xccdf_guidance_file.xml -J baseline_X_summary.json -c baseline_X_controls_directory
```

Additional capabilities can be obtained using the `-h or --help` flag on the `update_controls4delta` command as such:

```sh
saf generate update_controls4delta --help
```

Renaming of controls can be done either by guidance rules (rule ID, default) or using the group ID. When using rule ID legacy fields contained within the XCCDF are used for identifying the proper mapping for the controls.

If there is no way to trace controls in baseline X to its corresponding controls in baseline Y, then `update_controls4delta` will not update any controls (no mapping).

### 3.3 Delta

The `delta` process extends the capabilities of the `update_controls4delta` process by providing the following functionalities:

1. Creates new controls found in updated guidances
2. Fuzzy matching capability (optional)
    a - Maps controls based on similarity and not control IDs
    b - For controls which a match is found, the describe block (code) within the old control is mapped over to the new control
3. Detailed logging
    a - report file (.md), mapping statistics (CliProcessOutput.log)

You can invoke the command as such:

```sh
saf generate delta -X ./baseline_Y_xccdf_guidance_file.xml -J baseline_X_summary.json -o new_baseline_Y_controls_directory -M -c baseline_X_controls_directory
```

::: tip Optional Fuzzy Matching Flags
The `-M` and `-c` flags can be removed if not using fuzzy matching feature.
:::

Additional capabilities can be obtained using the `-h or --help` flag on the `delta` command as such:

```sh
saf generate delta --help
```
