## The Road to Security Automation

InSpec is one of the tools in the Security Automation workflow, it operates easily within most orchestration and Configuration Management tools found in the DevOps world.

As you can see from the picture below, the process from Requirement Documents - like SRGs, STIGs and CIS Benchmarks - to visualized test results is a bit of a journey.

This challenge is what the [MITRE Security Automation Framework](https://saf.mitre.org) or MITRE SAF was developed to simplify.  

The SAF's purpose is to make the journey from Requirement Document to automated tests and back again a little easier to navigate.
